# H1 Hello, I am very new to this.
---
I am currently working my way through the [Pluralsight 'Practical Python for Beginners'](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/practical-python-beginners) course, and this particular repo is just where all that newb code lives. I'm super new to this, and I'm also *old as hell*, so if you see anything I'm not doing right, that's probably why.

This repo will also probably house code for all the Pluralsight classes I take after this, so if you're into that kind of thing or you're looking to see how I did a thing, **stay tuned!**
